# Wintermute
A behavior-driven, automated software testing application, utilizing Cucumber and Java

“Wintermute was a simple cube of white light, that very simplicity suggesting extreme complexity.”  
    ― William Gibson, Neuromancer

## Project Goals
To develop an application that is capable, with minor end-user input, of interfacing with any software able to receive external input and provide task execution results. Wintermute will utilize behavior-driven testing philosophies to complete series of repeatable, robust test executions without user input, and provide those results to the test management application of the user's choice.
